<p><img src="headshot.jpg" alt="Headshot Photo of Michael" align="right" style="border-style: outset;border-color: green">I will be majoring in computer science with a concentration in cybersecurity 
from Lone Star College in Spring 2024. I love to learn and am always excited about technology!
<br><br>
I have experience in programing in C++ and Java. I'm currently taking a course 
on Python. I often help friends and family with their computer issues including setting up a 
new system, troubleshooting software issues, and more. I also have a good working knowledge of Windows, 
word processing, spreadsheets, and more. It would be my pleasure to bring my valuable skills to any team!
<br><br>
In addition, I have worked in customer service positions since I was 16. I worked at Kroger as a bagger
and a cashier. In addition, I worked at Chick-fil-A in high school and when I am home from college. 
Both jobs require a constant professional manner and high customer service. This has provided me with my 
excellent communication skills.</p>
